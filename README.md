## 📝 **Top Kaggle Notebooks**

### [1️⃣ Healthy Fast Foods: KMeans and Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vijay20213/healthy-fast-foods-kmeans-and-visualization)  
> **Description:**  
> In this project, I explored **healthy fast foods** and clustered them into three groups based on calorie count. Using these clusters, I identified the healthiest fast food category. This will help people avoid harmful fast foods.  
> **Achievements:** Bronze Medal 🏅 | 4,604 Views 📊  

### [2️⃣ Cancer Prediction with 98% Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vijay20213/cancer-prediction-with-98-accuracy)  
> **Description:**  
> This project focuses on **image processing** and the construction of a **CNN model** to predict cancer with 98% accuracy. I also analyzed the model’s performance metrics.  
> **Achievements:** Bronze Medal 🏅 | 1,621 Views 📊  

### [3️⃣ Pneumonia Detection with CNN and ML with 98% Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vijay20213/pneumonia-detection-with-cnn-and-ml-with-98-acc)  
> **Description:**  
> I trained a **CNN model** using **17,000 X-ray images** to build a model for pneumonia detection. The project includes a website for easy interaction with the model.  
> **Achievements:** Bronze Medal 🏅 | 2,000 Views 📊
